These files were originally developed by Jason O'Neil on his own time, but have been contributed to during his employment at Sheridan Research Institute.  Under his contract there he was permitted to work on Shared Code which he retained full rights to, but which Sheridan also gained rights to use.  Under his rights, he is now releasing these as an MIT licensed library, so that both Sheridan SMS and ClassHomie may benefit from it's maintenance, and so it may benefit other projects.
